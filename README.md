Shell script for backlight control.

## Step 1
Paste these files in your computer.
Locate backlight folder for you pc and change the /path according to it.

## Step 2
Bind 3 keyboard shorcuts :
### 1 "pkexec sh /path/a.sh"      //this wil change the write permission of backlight file
### 2 "sh /path/inc_baclit.sh"   //increasing backlight brightness
### 2 "sh /path/dec_baclit.sh"   //decreasing backlight brightness

## Step 3 
Press the 1st key bind. You need this once everytime you start your pc.
After that you can change the brightness with 2nd and 3rd bind.
